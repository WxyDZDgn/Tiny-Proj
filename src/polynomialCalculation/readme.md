# Polynomial Calculation

## Overall

This is a project to calculate for polynomials, and single polynomial itself.

## Details

In the Main class, the example tries to make calculations. Adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing and getting
remainder between two polynomials are included. Getting degree, ratio roots, etc. for one single polynomial are also
covered.

In the Polynomial class, using a list to restore the coefficients of the polynomial. Note that, to find the ratio roots
of a polynomial, using the Rational Root Theorem.

In the Fraction class, using two BigInteger to store the numerator and the denominator of one ratio.
